  <!-- By default, the App-Services server uses Documents and Modules as its content/modules databases. Keeping those and 
    supporting failover for this server would require replicas of Documents and Modules. But if you're only really using qconsole, 
    you can safely set the content database to App-Services and the modules-database to "filesystem" (i.e. 0), which means you 
    only need replica forests for App-Services, which you need anyways for qconsole to work. -->
