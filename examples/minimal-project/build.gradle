/*
 * The most minimal ml-gradle file just has the below two things - we need to include the MarkLogic Maven repository,
 * and we need to reference the ml-gradle plugin. 
 *
 * Without a gradle.properties file with properties such as mlAppName and mlRestPort, ml-gradle will use some sensible
 * defaults to generate a new application - an app name of my-app, port 8003, and a username/password combo of 
 * admin/admin.
