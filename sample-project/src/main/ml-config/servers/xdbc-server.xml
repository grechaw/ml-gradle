  <!-- This is an example of referring to another resource that has already been created by its ID. ml-gradle (specifically, 
    ml-app-deployer) will store key/value pairs in the AppConfig customTokens map for certain resources, such as certificate 
    templates, which are referenced by their ID, not by their resource name. Since the resource ID is auto-generated by MarkLogic, 
    we need a way of saving it during a deployment and then referring to it later. -->
